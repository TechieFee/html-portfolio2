<h1>Best Movies According To Felicia</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Sudden Fear</h3>
 <p>
    This is my favorite movie because Joan Crawford is my favorite
    actress of the early 1900s. She plays a rich woman who with time
    warms up to a man and decides to marry him until she finds out that
    he is planning to kill her for her fortune. She then flips the script and 
    plots on her revenge. A definite must see film.

 <h3>Dirty Dancing</h3>
 <p>
    The main character, Baby, lives a sheltered life of a teenage girl from a 
    wealthy family. Her family goes on a cabin retreat every year with other elite members, which
    is usually very boring to her. This time she is surprised to meet a young man 
    that will change her life played by Patrick Swayze.

 <h3>Not Another Teen Movie</h3>
 <p>
    This is a hilarious movie that mimics all of the teen drama movies from the 90s. It 
    uses scenes from the movies and turns it into comedy. This is a must see if you love to laugh.
